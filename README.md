# Technical Lecture Source Repository

This repository houses source files for several of the technical lectures
regularly presented at TTB Workshops.  The goal is to assemble a modular
set of material that can be used for future workshops.

## Rules

Each lecture should be given its own subdirectory containing all the files
necessary to build and/or modify the lecture.
